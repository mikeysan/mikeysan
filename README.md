### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Mikey here. 
This is the boring section where I ramble on hoping to say something exciting that makes you visit me again. It just so happens that I am not in the mood for that right now, so I'll simply say, Remember to smile at least once today.

Below is a list of what I am up to at the moment. I won't bore you or fill space by promising things that are more wishlists than actual plans. So you can be sure that what's listed is actually what's happening in my life right now. 

*hmm...note to self, maybe use actions to update that list when things change.*

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python based bots for discord, twitter, and any other API I can get my hands on.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with contributing to open source in a meaningful way
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux and Photography (Python later)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
